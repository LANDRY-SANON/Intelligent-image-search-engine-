# Intelligent-image-search-engine

Functionalities reflecting the idea of an intelligent image search system based on computer vision and image processing methods have been implemented. Here are the functionalities that have been implemented: 
* Search for similar images 
  * by color histogram method
  * using the SIFT method
  * Using a pre-trained medele (INCEPTION) as a feature extractor
* Locating objects in an image folder from YOLO 
* Facial recognition in an image folder using combined methods ( landmark prediction , SIFT )
* Brand-targeted shoe recommendation
* Image search from image fragments (with fragment localization)
* Search for images containing specific text

**NB** : The idea was not to necessarily use the most effective methods for each feature, but to explore different methods and appreciate their capabilities.

You'll find :
* **Intelligent image search engine.ipynb** : The main notebook containing details of our work
* **Notebook Interface.ipynb** : A notebook with a small integrated interface for easy handling of the various functions

* **"tkinter app" folder** containing the code for our tkinter application, to provide a better desktop interface for manipulating our functions

If you need the drive containing the weights of our models, as well as other files to make these notebooks work properly, please don't hesitate to contact us,
this drive folder is also needed to run the tkinter application, as you'll need to download it, rename it 'IISEngine_required_file', place it in the app folder and install the specifications. simply place it in the app folder and install the specifications. A compiled .exe version also exists in the same drive, allowing you to skip all these steps.
